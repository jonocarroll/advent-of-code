#' **Part One**
#'
#' Why not search for the Chief Historian near the [gardener](/2023/day/5)
#' and his [massive farm](/2023/day/21)? There\'s plenty of food, so The
#' Historians grab something to eat while they search.
#' 
#' You\'re about to settle near a complex arrangement of garden plots when
#' some Elves ask if you can lend a hand. They\'d like to set up
#' [fences]{title="I originally wanted to title this puzzle \"Fencepost Problem\", but I was afraid someone would then try to count fenceposts by mistake and experience a fencepost problem."}
#' around each region of garden plots, but they can\'t figure out how much
#' fence they need to order or how much it will cost. They hand you a map
#' (your puzzle input) of the garden plots.
#' 
#' Each garden plot grows only a single type of plant and is indicated by a
#' single letter on your map. When multiple garden plots are growing the
#' same type of plant and are touching (horizontally or vertically), they
#' form a *region*. For example:
#' 
#'     AAAA
#'     BBCD
#'     BBCC
#'     EEEC
#' 
#' This 4x4 arrangement includes garden plots growing five different types
#' of plants (labeled `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E`), each grouped into their
#' own region.
#' 
#' In order to accurately calculate the cost of the fence around a single
#' region, you need to know that region\'s *area* and *perimeter*.
#' 
#' The *area* of a region is simply the number of garden plots the region
#' contains. The above map\'s type `A`, `B`, and `C` plants are each in a
#' region of area `4`. The type `E` plants are in a region of area `3`; the
#' type `D` plants are in a region of area `1`.
#' 
#' Each garden plot is a square and so has *four sides*. The *perimeter* of
#' a region is the number of sides of garden plots in the region that do
#' not touch another garden plot in the same region. The type `A` and `C`
#' plants are each in a region with perimeter `10`. The type `B` and `E`
#' plants are each in a region with perimeter `8`. The lone `D` plot forms
#' its own region with perimeter `4`.
#' 
#' Visually indicating the sides of plots in each region that contribute to
#' the perimeter using `-` and `|`, the above map\'s regions\' perimeters
#' are measured as follows:
#' 
#'     +-+-+-+-+
#'     |A A A A|
#'     +-+-+-+-+     +-+
#'                   |D|
#'     +-+-+   +-+   +-+
#'     |B B|   |C|
#'     +   +   + +-+
#'     |B B|   |C C|
#'     +-+-+   +-+ +
#'               |C|
#'     +-+-+-+   +-+
#'     |E E E|
#'     +-+-+-+
#' 
#' Plants of the same type can appear in multiple separate regions, and
#' regions can even appear within other regions. For example:
#' 
#'     OOOOO
#'     OXOXO
#'     OOOOO
#'     OXOXO
#'     OOOOO
#' 
#' The above map contains *five* regions, one containing all of the `O`
#' garden plots, and the other four each containing a single `X` plot.
#' 
#' The four `X` regions each have area `1` and perimeter `4`. The region
#' containing `21` type `O` plants is more complicated; in addition to its
#' outer edge contributing a perimeter of `20`, its boundary with each `X`
#' region contributes an additional `4` to its perimeter, for a total
#' perimeter of `36`.
#' 
#' Due to \"modern\" business practices, the *price* of fence required for
#' a region is found by *multiplying* that region\'s area by its perimeter.
#' The *total price* of fencing all regions on a map is found by adding
#' together the price of fence for every region on the map.
#' 
#' In the first example, region `A` has price `4 * 10 = 40`, region `B` has
#' price `4 * 8 = 32`, region `C` has price `4 * 10 = 40`, region `D` has
#' price `1 * 4 = 4`, and region `E` has price `3 * 8 = 24`. So, the total
#' price for the first example is *`140`*.
#' 
#' In the second example, the region with all of the `O` plants has price
#' `21 * 36 = 756`, and each of the four smaller `X` regions has price
#' `1 * 4 = 4`, for a total price of *`772`* (`756 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4`).
#' 
#' Here\'s a larger example:
#' 
#'     RRRRIICCFF
#'     RRRRIICCCF
#'     VVRRRCCFFF
#'     VVRCCCJFFF
#'     VVVVCJJCFE
#'     VVIVCCJJEE
#'     VVIIICJJEE
#'     MIIIIIJJEE
#'     MIIISIJEEE
#'     MMMISSJEEE
#' 
#' It contains:
#' 
#' -   A region of `R` plants with price `12 * 18 = 216`.
#' -   A region of `I` plants with price `4 * 8 = 32`.
#' -   A region of `C` plants with price `14 * 28 = 392`.
#' -   A region of `F` plants with price `10 * 18 = 180`.
#' -   A region of `V` plants with price `13 * 20 = 260`.
#' -   A region of `J` plants with price `11 * 20 = 220`.
#' -   A region of `C` plants with price `1 * 4 = 4`.
#' -   A region of `E` plants with price `13 * 18 = 234`.
#' -   A region of `I` plants with price `14 * 22 = 308`.
#' -   A region of `M` plants with price `5 * 12 = 60`.
#' -   A region of `S` plants with price `3 * 8 = 24`.
#' 
#' So, it has a total price of *`1930`*.
#' 
#' *What is the total price of fencing all regions on your map?*
#'
#' **Part Two**
#' 
#' Fortunately, the Elves are trying to order so much fence that they
#' qualify for a *bulk discount*!
#' 
#' Under the bulk discount, instead of using the perimeter to calculate the
#' price, you need to use the *number of sides* each region has. Each
#' straight section of fence counts as a side, regardless of how long it
#' is.
#' 
#' Consider this example again:
#' 
#'     AAAA
#'     BBCD
#'     BBCC
#'     EEEC
#' 
#' The region containing type `A` plants has `4` sides, as does each of the
#' regions containing plants of type `B`, `D`, and `E`. However, the more
#' complex region containing the plants of type `C` has `8` sides!
#' 
#' Using the new method of calculating the per-region price by multiplying
#' the region\'s area by its number of sides, regions `A` through `E` have
#' prices `16`, `16`, `32`, `4`, and `12`, respectively, for a total price
#' of *`80`*.
#' 
#' The second example above (full of type `X` and `O` plants) would have a
#' total price of *`436`*.
#' 
#' Here\'s a map that includes an E-shaped region full of type `E` plants:
#' 
#'     EEEEE
#'     EXXXX
#'     EEEEE
#'     EXXXX
#'     EEEEE
#' 
#' The E-shaped region has an area of `17` and `12` sides for a price of
#' `204`. Including the two regions full of type `X` plants, this map has a
#' total price of *`236`*.
#' 
#' This map has a total price of *`368`*:
#' 
#'     AAAAAA
#'     AAABBA
#'     AAABBA
#'     ABBAAA
#'     ABBAAA
#'     AAAAAA
#' 
#' It includes two regions full of type `B` plants (each with `4` sides)
#' and a single region full of type `A` plants (with `4` sides on the
#' outside and `8` more sides on the inside, a total of `12` sides). Be
#' especially careful when counting the fence around regions like the one
#' full of type `A` plants; in particular, each section of fence has an
#' in-side and an out-side, so the fence does not connect across the middle
#' of the region (where the two `B` regions touch diagonally). (The Elves
#' would have used the MÃ¶bius Fencing Company instead, but their contract
#' terms were too one-sided.)
#' 
#' The larger example from before now has the following updated prices:
#' 
#' -   A region of `R` plants with price `12 * 10 = 120`.
#' -   A region of `I` plants with price `4 * 4 = 16`.
#' -   A region of `C` plants with price `14 * 22 = 308`.
#' -   A region of `F` plants with price `10 * 12 = 120`.
#' -   A region of `V` plants with price `13 * 10 = 130`.
#' -   A region of `J` plants with price `11 * 12 = 132`.
#' -   A region of `C` plants with price `1 * 4 = 4`.
#' -   A region of `E` plants with price `13 * 8 = 104`.
#' -   A region of `I` plants with price `14 * 16 = 224`.
#' -   A region of `M` plants with price `5 * 6 = 30`.
#' -   A region of `S` plants with price `3 * 6 = 18`.
#' 
#' Adding these together produces its new total price of *`1206`*.
#' 
#' *What is the new total price of fencing all regions on your map?*
