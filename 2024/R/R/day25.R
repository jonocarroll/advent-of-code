#' **Part One**
#'
#' Out of ideas and time, The Historians agree that they should go back to
#' check the *Chief Historian\'s office* one last time, just in case he
#' went back there without you noticing.
#' 
#' When you get there, you are surprised to discover that the door to his
#' office is *locked*! You can hear someone inside, but knocking
#' [yields]{title="function knock() {
#'   yield no_response;
#' }"} no response. The locks on this floor are all fancy, expensive,
#' virtual versions of [five-pin tumbler
#' locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_tumbler_lock){target="_blank"},
#' so you contact North Pole security to see if they can help open the
#' door.
#' 
#' Unfortunately, they\'ve lost track of which locks are installed and
#' which keys go with them, so the best they can do is send over
#' *schematics of every lock and every key* for the floor you\'re on (your
#' puzzle input).
#' 
#' The schematics are in a cryptic file format, but they do contain
#' manufacturer information, so you look up their support number.
#' 
#' \"Our Virtual Five-Pin Tumbler product? That\'s our most expensive
#' model! *Way* more secure than\--\" You explain that you need to open a
#' door and don\'t have a lot of time.
#' 
#' \"Well, you can\'t know whether a key opens a lock without actually
#' trying the key in the lock (due to quantum hidden variables), but you
#' *can* rule out some of the key/lock combinations.\"
#' 
#' \"The virtual system is complicated, but part of it really is a crude
#' simulation of a five-pin tumbler lock, mostly for marketing reasons. If
#' you look at the schematics, you can figure out whether a key could
#' possibly fit in a lock.\"
#' 
#' He transmits you some example schematics:
#' 
#'     #####
#'     .####
#'     .####
#'     .####
#'     .#.#.
#'     .#...
#'     .....

#' 
#' \"The locks are schematics that have the top row filled (`#`) and the
#' bottom row empty (`.`); the keys have the top row empty and the bottom
#' row filled. If you look closely, you\'ll see that each schematic is
#' actually a set of columns of various heights, either extending downward
#' from the top (for locks) or upward from the bottom (for keys).\"
#' 
#' \"For locks, those are the pins themselves; you can convert the pins in
#' schematics to a list of heights, one per column. For keys, the columns
#' make up the shape of the key where it aligns with pins; those can also
#' be converted to a list of heights.\"
#' 
#' \"So, you could say the first lock has pin heights `0,5,3,4,3`:\"
#' 
#'     #####
#'     .####
#'     .####
#'     .####
#'     .#.#.
#'     .#...
#'     .....
#' 
#' \"Or, that the first key has heights `5,0,2,1,3`:\"
#' 
#'     .....
#'     #....
#'     #....
#'     #...#
#'     #.#.#
#'     #.###
#'     #####
#' 
#' \"These seem like they should fit together; in the first four columns,
#' the pins and key don\'t overlap. However, this key *cannot* be for this
#' lock: in the rightmost column, the lock\'s pin overlaps with the key,
#' which you know because in that column the sum of the lock height and key
#' height is more than the available space.\"
#' 
#' \"So anyway, you can narrow down the keys you\'d need to try by just
#' testing each key with each lock, which means you would have to check\...
#' wait, you have *how* many locks? But the only installation *that* size
#' is at the North\--\" You disconnect the call.
#' 
#' In this example, converting both locks to pin heights produces:
#' 
#'     0,5,3,4,3
#'     1,2,0,5,3
#' 
#' Converting all three keys to heights produces:
#' 
#'     5,0,2,1,3
#'     4,3,4,0,2
#'     3,0,2,0,1
#' 
#' Then, you can try every key with every lock:
#' 
#' -   Lock `0,5,3,4,3` and key `5,0,2,1,3`: *overlap* in the last column.
#' -   Lock `0,5,3,4,3` and key `4,3,4,0,2`: *overlap* in the second
#'     column.
#' -   Lock `0,5,3,4,3` and key `3,0,2,0,1`: all columns *fit*!
#' -   Lock `1,2,0,5,3` and key `5,0,2,1,3`: *overlap* in the first column.
#' -   Lock `1,2,0,5,3` and key `4,3,4,0,2`: all columns *fit*!
#' -   Lock `1,2,0,5,3` and key `3,0,2,0,1`: all columns *fit*!
#' 
#' So, in this example, the number of unique lock/key pairs that fit
#' together without overlapping in any column is *`3`*.
#' 
#' Analyze your lock and key schematics. *How many unique lock/key pairs
#' fit together without overlapping in any column?*
#'
#' **Part Two**
#' 
#' You and The Historians crowd into the office, startling the Chief
#' Historian awake! The Historians all take turns looking confused until
#' one asks where he\'s been for the last few months.
#' 
#' \"I\'ve been right here, working on this high-priority request from
#' Santa! I think the only time I even stepped away was about a month ago
#' when I went to grab a cup of coffee\...\"
#' 
#' Just then, the Chief notices the time. \"Oh no! I\'m going to be late! I
#' must have fallen asleep trying to put the finishing touches on this
#' *chronicle* Santa requested, but now I don\'t have enough time to go
#' visit the last 50 places on my list and complete the chronicle before
#' Santa leaves! He said he needed it before tonight\'s sleigh launch.\"
#' 
#' One of The Historians holds up the list they\'ve been using this whole
#' time to keep track of where they\'ve been searching. Next to each place
#' you all visited, they checked off that place with a *star*. Other
#' Historians hold up their own notes they took on the journey; as The
#' Historians, how could they resist writing everything down while visiting
#' all those historically significant places?
#' 
#' The Chief\'s eyes get wide. \"With all this, we might just have enough
#' time to finish the chronicle! Santa said he wanted it wrapped up with a
#' bow, so I\'ll call down to the wrapping department and\... hey, could
#' *you* bring it up to Santa? I\'ll need to be in my seat to watch the
#' sleigh launch by then.\"
#' 
#' You nod, and The Historians quickly work to collect their notes into the
#' final set of pages for the chronicle.
