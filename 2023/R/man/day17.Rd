\strong{Part One}

The lava starts flowing rapidly once the Lava Production Facility is
operational. As you [leave]{title="see you soon?"}, the reindeer offers
you a parachute, allowing you to quickly reach Gear Island.

As you descend, your bird\'s-eye view of Gear Island reveals why you had
trouble finding anyone on your way up: half of Gear Island is empty, but
the half below you is a giant factory city!

You land near the gradually-filling pool of lava at the base of your new
\emph{lavafall}. Lavaducts will eventually carry the lava throughout the
city, but to make use of it immediately, Elves are loading it into large
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible}{crucibles}{target="_blank"} on
wheels.

The crucibles are top-heavy and pushed by hand. Unfortunately, the
crucibles become very difficult to steer at high speeds, and so it can
be hard to go in a straight line for very long.

To get Desert Island the machine parts it needs as soon as possible,
you\'ll need to find the best way to get the crucible \emph{from the lava
pool to the machine parts factory}. To do this, you need to minimize
\emph{heat loss} while choosing a route that doesn\'t require the crucible to
go in a \emph{straight line} for too long.

Fortunately, the Elves here have a map (your puzzle input) that uses
traffic patterns, ambient temperature, and hundreds of other parameters
to calculate exactly how much heat loss can be expected for a crucible
entering any particular city block.

For example:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{2413432311323
3215453535623
3255245654254
3446585845452
4546657867536
1438598798454
4457876987766
3637877979653
4654967986887
4564679986453
1224686865563
2546548887735
4322674655533
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Each city block is marked by a single digit that represents the \emph{amount
of heat loss if the crucible enters that block}. The starting point, the
lava pool, is the top-left city block; the destination, the machine
parts factory, is the bottom-right city block. (Because you already
start in the top-left block, you don\'t incur that block\'s heat loss
unless you leave that block and then return to it.)

Because it is difficult to keep the top-heavy crucible going in a
straight line for very long, it can move \emph{at most three blocks} in a
single direction before it must turn 90 degrees left or right. The
crucible also can\'t reverse direction; after entering each city block,
it may only turn left, continue straight, or turn right.

One way to \emph{minimize heat loss} is this path:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{2>>34^>>>1323
32v>>>35v5623
32552456v>>54
3446585845v52
4546657867v>6
14385987984v4
44578769877v6
36378779796v>
465496798688v
456467998645v
12246868655<v
25465488877v5
43226746555v>
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

This path never moves more than three consecutive blocks in the same
direction and incurs a heat loss of only \emph{\code{102}}.

Directing the crucible from the lava pool to the machine parts factory,
but not moving more than three consecutive blocks in the same direction,
\emph{what is the least heat loss it can incur?}

\strong{Part Two}

The crucibles of lava simply aren\'t large enough to provide an adequate
supply of lava to the machine parts factory. Instead, the Elves are
going to upgrade to \emph{ultra crucibles}.

Ultra crucibles are even more difficult to steer than normal crucibles.
Not only do they have trouble going in a straight line, but they also
have trouble turning!

Once an ultra crucible starts moving in a direction, it needs to move \emph{a
minimum of four blocks} in that direction before it can turn (or even
before it can stop at the end). However, it will eventually start to get
wobbly: an ultra crucible can move a maximum of \emph{ten consecutive blocks}
without turning.

In the above example, an ultra crucible could follow this path to
minimize heat loss:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{2>>>>>>>>1323
32154535v5623
32552456v4254
34465858v5452
45466578v>>>>
143859879845v
445787698776v
363787797965v
465496798688v
456467998645v
122468686556v
254654888773v
432267465553v
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

In the above example, an ultra crucible would incur the minimum possible
heat loss of \emph{\code{94}}.

Here\'s another example:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{111111111111
999999999991
999999999991
999999999991
999999999991
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Sadly, an ultra crucible would need to take an unfortunate path like
this one:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{1>>>>>>>1111
9999999v9991
9999999v9991
9999999v9991
9999999v>>>>
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

This route causes the ultra crucible to incur the minimum possible heat
loss of \emph{\code{71}}.

Directing the \emph{ultra crucible} from the lava pool to the machine parts
factory, \emph{what is the least heat loss it can incur?}
